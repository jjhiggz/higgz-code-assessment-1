# Assessment Mod 0

Welcome to your first assessment. The good news is that these assessments are not graded, they are pass/fail. The bad news is that you have to be able to do everything in this assessment before passing on to the next module. The good news is that you can take this as many times as you want, including during project week. My reccomendation is that you try and pass before project week as best as you can so that way you can focus on your project.

This assessment is pretty simple. Make an HTML page, create the project directory from your terminal, then save it on to github. Here are the requirements.

- Open your project in VSCode
- Have one H1 element
- Have one list
- Have one link to another website.
- Have one link to another HTML page that you are hosting.
- Make a github repo for this project.
